# !! THIS MOD IS DEPRECATED !!


# Sandbox Menu
A general mod-menu, or how people call it the 'sanbox menu' for noita.

## General focus
I want to make mod to just get mostly every item from the game. (Atleast every standard item).

## Features

- Spawn in spells and perks of choice
- Spawn in wands from level 1-6
- Spawn in props, mobs and pickups
- Spawn in particles
- Spawn in Flasks
- Teleport to saved locations (Not too many yet)
- Godmode, Infinite boost, Infinite spells and more
- Save locations on the go
- Craft your own wands
- Draw and erase materials

## Spawnable from other mods
- Spells inserted in `gun/gun_actions.lua`
- Materials inserted in cell_factory (Will mean more flasks)
- Perks inserted in `perks/perk_list`
